## 🧩 How It Works

- **Push/Pop Navigation:**  
  `Navigator.push()` → Moves to new screen  
  `Navigator.pop()` → Returns to previous screen  

- **Named Routes Navigation:**  
  Routes are defined inside `MaterialApp(routes: {...})`  
  and accessed using `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/routeName')`.
